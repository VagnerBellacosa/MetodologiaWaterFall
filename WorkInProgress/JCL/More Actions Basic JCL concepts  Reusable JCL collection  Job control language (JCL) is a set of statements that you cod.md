| ![img](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/zosbasics/com.ibm.zaddinfo.doc/dblue_rule.gif)Job control language (JCL) is a set of statements that you code to tell the z/OSÂ® operating system about the work you want it to perform. Although this set of statements is quite large, most jobs can be run using a very small subset. Learn about essential and most frequently used JCL statements and parameters, as well as coding techniques.JCL statements tell z/OS where to find the appropriate input, how to process that input (that is, what program or programs to run), and what to do with the resulting output.All jobs use three main types of JCL statements:One JOB statement to identify the unit of work the operating system is to performOne or more EXEC statements, depending on the number of job steps within the jobOne or more DD statements to identify the input and output data sets**[JCL statements: What does the JOB statement do?](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/zosbasics/com.ibm.zos.zjcl/zjclc_jclJOBstmt.htm)** The JOB statement is the first control statement in a job. It marks the beginning of a job and also specifies the name of the job.**[JCL statements: What does the EXEC statement do?](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/zosbasics/com.ibm.zos.zjcl/zjclc_jclEXECstmt.htm)** The EXEC statement marks the beginning of a step within a job, and specifies the name of a program or cataloged procedure to be run.**[JCL statements: What does the DD statement do?](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/zosbasics/com.ibm.zos.zjcl/zjclc_jclDDstmt.htm)** Data definition (DD) statements define the data sets that a program or procedure uses when it runs. You must code one DD statement for each data set that is used or created within a job step.[![Go to the previous page](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/zosbasics/com.ibm.zos.zjcl/pageback.gif)](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/zosbasics/com.ibm.zos.zjcl/zjclt_smpldelVSAMclusters.htm) ![img](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/zosbasics/com.ibm.zos.zjcl/pagemid.gif) [![Go to the next page](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/zosbasics/com.ibm.zos.zjcl/pagenext.gif)](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/zosbasics/com.ibm.zos.zjcl/zjclc_jclJOBstmt.htm) |
