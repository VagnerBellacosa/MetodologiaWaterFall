Introducing AWS Mainframe Modernization | Amazon Web Services

What is AWS Mainframe Modernization?

AWS Mainframe Modernization is a unique platform that allows you to migrate your on-premises mainframe workloads to a managed runtime environment on AWS. Mainframe Modernization enables two popular migration patterns: replatforming and automated refactoring.

## Use cases

### Migrate mainframe workloads

Migrate faster by refactoring legacy language applications to Java-based services, or re-platforming mainframe applications.
