### White Paper

# Mainframe to Cloud: Design Once, Deploy Anywhere in a Hybrid World

## 3 Examples of Organizations Leveraging Mainframe Data in the Cloud

Leveraging mainframe data with new platforms, such as cloud, can generate a great deal of value for a business. But mainframe data is complex, so finding ways to simplify is essential for getting a return on your investment.

The expression, what’s old is new again, has a lot of relevance for mainframe data. Valuable mainframe data can become even more powerful when it’s accessible in the cloud. But the complexity of working with mainframe data – particularly in organizations that no longer have those skills in-house – can be a significant challenge, as these systems don’t always integrate seamlessly with today’s newest technology. Mainframe developers applied many design tricks to save on space, and as a result, much of the data coming from these systems is generated in formats that are unfamiliar to many, including those who are skilled in working with newer data platforms.

Even when an organization manages to get its mainframe data to the cloud, the job is typically not over. If transactions continue to take place on the mainframe, those changes need to be reflected in the cloud.

In addition, many organizations have multiple cloud deployments or will switch cloud vendors over time.

Multi-cloud deployments make a lot of sense, as they prevent companies from experiencing vendor and technological lock-in. But they also add to the complexity of hybrid environments, making it more important than ever to do the work of data integration in general, and mainframe data access in particular, in a way that can support on-premise and multiple cloud environments without having to start from scratch for each deployment. The name for such a capability is “design once, deploy anywhere.”

A design once, deploy anywhere system is critical in order to:

- Put your mainframe data to work in a hybrid cloud world
- Empower your company to focus on current and future business requirements rather than on details of mainframe formats or optimizing for specific cloud implementations

Download our white paper to learn more about the benefits of design once, deploy anywhere systems and explore 3 real-world examples of how organizations today are leveraging mainframe data in the cloud.
