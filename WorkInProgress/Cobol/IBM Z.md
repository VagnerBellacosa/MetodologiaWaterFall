*So you’ve never heard of **IBM Z**? Or maybe you’ve heard of it but want to know more? Either way, you’ve come to the right place! This introductory Q&A will help you get your bearings and get you started on your journey to understanding IBM Z and how it can help your enterprise build and maintain applications in a private, secure, and resilient hybrid multicloud environment.*

**What is IBM Z?**

[IBM Z](https://www.ibm.com/it-infrastructure/z) is a family name that’s used by IBM for all of its z/Architecture [mainframe](https://www.ibm.com/it-infrastructure/z/education/what-is-a-mainframe) computers, beginning with the [z900](https://www.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/mainframe/mainframe_PR900.html) released in 2000 to today’s IBM [z15](https://developer.ibm.com/components/ibmz/blogs/systems-inside-the-new-ibm-z15) released in September 2019. (The “Z” stands for “zero downtime,” which reflects the reliability of the system.) IBM Z uses the IBM [S/390](https://www.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/mainframe/mainframe_PP390G1.html) chip architecture. Data that’s handled by IBM Z is encrypted by dedicated encryption processors over the complete ecosystem, and encryption keys are handled with the most secure hardware security module (HSM) in the industry — which means it is highly secured.

**How is the IBM Z architecture different from that of other servers?**

IBM Z has its own architecture which is designed to work with huge caches, and it has instruction sets to handle enterprise workloads by using IBM’s own S/390x chip architecture. The S/390x architecture is supported by several popular Linux operating systems including SUSE, Red Hat, and Ubuntu, as well as a large number of open source applications.

**What are the various OS options for Z?**

IBM Z runs operating systems including z/OS, z/VM, z/VSE, z/TPF, and Linux. In fact, it is common for multiple operating systems to run on a single mainframe. [LinuxONE](https://www.ibm.com/it-infrastructure/linuxone) is an IBM Z system that’s specifically dedicated to running Linux; this combines the benefits of the Linux OS with the capabilities and strengths of the mainframe like outstanding data security, availability, performance, efficiency, and cost savings.

**What are some examples of IBM Z in use today?**

IBM Z is used by 44 of the top 50 banks and all top 10 insurers worldwide, as well as a large number of government, healthcare, airline, and retail organizations and other companies that require the highest standards for performance, security, reliability, and availability. Visit the [IBM Z case studies and customer success stories](https://www.ibm.com/it-infrastructure/z/resources/case-studies) website for more examples.
